        This method calculated the root of the input function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        diff_eq : function
            Function be solved. The function must accept the following inputs:
            - fluxes : function used to calculate the fluxes given parameters
                       and state
            - S : proposed root. If None, the function must initialize the root
            - S0 : state at the beginning of the time step
            - dt : time step
            - kwargs : other parameters needed by diff_eq
            It must return three float values:
            - Value of the function given the root and the kwargs
            - Lower x boundary for the search
            - Upper x boundary for the search
        fluxes : function
            Function to be passed to diff_eq. See specificatio in
