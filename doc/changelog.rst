Change log
==========

Version 1.3.2
-------------

Minor changes
.............

- `Pull request <https://github.com/dalmo1991/superflexPy/pull/9>`_ from
  `alessandro-mariotti-zupit <https://github.com/alessandro-mariotti-zupit>`_
  that upgrades python and packages versions.

Version 1.3.1
-------------

Minor changes
.............

- Added the classifier :code:`Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Hydrology`

Version 1.3.0
-------------

Major changes to existing components
....................................

- :code:`ODEsElements` can now return the derivative of the fluxes together with
  the fluxes. This enables the usage of numerical solvers that use the
  derivatives (e.g., Newton methods).
- Folder structure improved. The numerical approximators and the root finders
  have been moved from the folder :code:`implementation/computation` to
  :code:`implementation/numerical_approximators` and
  :code:`implementation/root_finders`, respectively. Names of the files have
  been slightly modified to be coherent with this new folder organization.

New code
........

- Implemented a new numerical approximator implementing Runge Kutta 4
- Implemented a new root finder implementing a Newton-bisection method
- Implemented a new root finder implementing a trivial algorithm to solve
  explicit algebraic equations.

Version 1.2.1
-------------

Minor changes
.............

- The network attribute :code:`topography` has been changed to :code:`topology`.

Version 1.2.0
-------------

Major changes to existing components
....................................

- The abbreviation of "differential equation" changes, in the code, from
  :code:`dif_eq` to :code:`diff_eq`. This change regards variables names, both
  in the methods arguments and implementation.

- The class :code:`FastReservoir` has been changed to :code:`PowerReservoir`. No
  changes in the functionality of the class.

Minor changes
.............

- Testing improved.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

Major changes to existing components
....................................

- Form this version, SuperflexPy is released under license LGPL. For details,
  read :ref:`license`

Minor changes to existing components
....................................

- Bug fix on the solution of the differential equations of the reservoirs. The
  calculation of the maximum storage was not correct.

Version 1.0.0
-------------

Version 1.0.0 represents the first mature release of SuperflexPy. Many aspects
have changed since earlier 0.x releases both in terms of code organization
and conceptualization of the framework. **Models built with versions 0.x are**
**not compatible with this version and with the following releases**.

Major changes to existing components
....................................

- New numerical solver structure for elements controlled by ordinary
  differential equations (ODEs). A new component, the
  :code:`NumericaApproximator` is introduced; its task it to get the fluxes from
  the elements and construct an approximation of the ODEs. In the previous
  release of the framework the approximation was hard coded in the element
  implementation.

- :code:`ODEsElement` have now to implement the methods :code:`_fluxes` and
  :code:`_fluxes_python` instead of :code:`_differential_equation`

- Added the possibility for nodes and units to have local states and parameters.
  To this end, some internal functionalities for finding the element given the
  :code:`id` have been changed to account for the presence of states and
  parameters at a level higher then the elements.

Minor changes to existing components
....................................

- Added implicit or explicit check at initialization of units, nodes, and
  network that the components that they contain are of the right type (e.g. a
  node must contain units)

- Minor changes to :code:`RootFinder` to accommodate the new numerical
  implementation.

- Added Numba implementation of GR4J elements

New code
........

- Added :code:`hymod` elements
